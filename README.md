## Overview
This project goal is to create your copy of [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/). You will find inside the [api]("/api") folder the necessary to run your own API instead of using the Flickr API.

## Rules

* You **MUST** create a git repository named `my-flickr`
* You **MUST** create a file called `.author`:

```sh
~/call-me-dev/learn-react/workshop/my-flickr ❯❯❯ cat -e .author
{
  "firstName": "Dylan",
  "lastName": "DE SOUSA"
}
```

## Goals

* Practice [React](https://reactjs.org/) basics: [props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html), [state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html), [jsx](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).
* Learn about [context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) and how to share data across your components
* Learn how to link an API with a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application
* Learn about Navigation with [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
